Dear IGN Team,

I am excited to apply for the IGN Code Foo Program, as I am passionate about gaming and front-end and back-end web development. As a Computer Science major at the University of North Texas, I have acquired a solid foundation in programming languages, algorithms, 
and data structures. But it was not until recently that I was introduced to web development in my senior Capstone class that I found I wanted to pivot my career to it. Since the beginning of this semester (Spring 23) it has been extrememly rewarding for me to
learn front-end and back-end web dev skills. I have a particular fondness for front-end becuase, aside from being a gamer in my spare time, I am also a designer and illustrator. It has been extremely fun to design our project's front-end and learn new tech like Next.js 
and React. I believe that this program would provide me with an excellent opportunity to apply and improve my skills while working with an industry-leading team.

My interest in gaming, and IGN has been a constant source of inspiration and knowledge for me. I have followed IGN for years, and I am impressed by the quality of their content and the passion they have for the gaming industry. IGN's commitment to providing 
in-depth coverage and analysis of the latest games and technology is what drew me to apply for the Code Foo Program.

My technical skills have been honed through several engineering projects that I have undertaken, including developing a wave-based survival game using the LARC engine, a barebones C++ engine, designing an efficient route search algorithm for airline routes, and 
creating a monster encounter game using looping algorithms and functions in C++. I have also worked on a personal project, programming a Discord bot in Python to respond to user commands and post random Magic the Gathering card images.

Additionally, my experience in IT support and administration has given me a strong foundation in customer service and organizational skills. As a Student Assistant at UNT Media Library, I interfaced with customers in person to troubleshoot console and 
PC games and co-hosted monthly gaming events. As an IT Technician at UNT Library Technologies, I communicated with customers to diagnose and solve computer hardware and software issues. Finally, as an Administration Specialist at UNT CLEAR, I managed the 
departmental budget, coordinated department events, and ensured efficient daily office operations.

If selected for the IGN Code Foo Program, I am committed to working hard and learning as much as possible from the IGN team. I am confident that my technical skills, passion for gaming and web development, and customer service experience make me an ideal 
candidate for this program. I am excited about the opportunity to work with IGN, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
