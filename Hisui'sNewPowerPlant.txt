To estimate the number of Voltorbs required to power Jubilife city, we need to consider the following factors:

1. The power consumption of Jubilife city.
2. The amount of electricity a single Voltorb can produce.
3. The availability of Voltorbs in the Sacred Plaza.

1. Power consumptiopn of Jubilife city:

We are going to assume for this question that Jubilife city, Sinnoh's largest city, is most likely based on Sapporo, 
Hokkaido's capital. From Bulbapedia, "[the Sinnoh region] is based on the northernmost major island of Japan, Hokkaido 
(北海道, Hokkaidō, literally "Northern Sea Circuit")...Sapporo is the capital and largest city of Hokkaido. The Jubilife TV 
building is a reference to the headquarters of Sapporo TV, the clock of the Pokétch Company [is based on] the 
Sapporo Clock Tower, the oldest clock tower in Japan [that was] built in an American style."

So, to understand Jubilife city's power consumption, we're going to compare it to the natiaonl average of Japan per capita.
According to the International Energy Agency, the average electricity consumption per capita in Japan in 2021 was about 
7.7 MWh/capita or 7,700 kWh/capita. Assuming that Sapporo's per capita electricity consumption is similar to the 
national average, we can estimate the city's daily electricity consumption as follows:

Daily electricity consumption = (7,700 kWh/year per capita) x (1.9 million people) / (365 days/year) = 401,315.07 kWh/day

2. The amount of electricity a single Voltorb can produce:

We know that Voltorbs are capable of producing electricity cleanly and efficiently. However, we don't know the exact 
amount of electricity that a single Voltorb can produce. Therefore, we need to make some assumptions based on similar species 
of Pokemon that can produce electricity, such as Pikachu or Electabuzz.

According to the Pokedex, Pikachu can produce a maximum voltage of 100,000 volts. This is from their "Thunderbolt" move or 
as it is known in Japan, "１０まんボルト 100,000 Volts". Assuming that Voltorb is equally capable of producing electricity, 
we can estimate the energy output of a single Voltorb as:

Energy output of a single Voltorb = 100,000 volts x 10.4 kg = 1,040,000 Joules
